**Concentration**, also known as _Match Match_, _Match Up_, _Memory_,
_Pelmanism_, _Shinkei-suijaku_, _Pexeso_ or simply _Pairs_, is a card game in
which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped
face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching
cards. ([Wikipedia][1])
